# brela's codewars showcase
This site is collection my coding challenges<br>
The purpose of this is to track my journey of learning JavaScript.<br>
Some of my coding challenges appear on this site, while the less interesting ones are in the repository <a href="https://github.com/Brela/coding-challenges" target="_blank">"coding-challenges"</a> without a User Interface

### tech used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
### notes
* the JS/codingChallenges-with-userInput.js file - JavaScript code to make the coding challenges work with user input (these are designated with stars ⭐ on the GUI)
* the JS/siteOperations.js file - JavaScript/ jQuery code to make the whole page and layout work - a user can click a list item on left and it's content displays in main section

### highlights
✔️used jQuery to make 'hover item shows preview' and to work only on device width > 1000px<br>
✔️used JS to create click events for each list item (see JS/siteOperation.js)<br>
✔️practiced keeping a large html file clean and organized<br>

### todo
* refactor siteOperations file to use event delegation
    * this will make code slightly cleaner and more efficient because then only one event listener will be used on parent vs all of the child events having their own even listener
