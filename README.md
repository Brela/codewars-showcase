## week 10-17-2022
### added entries:
* 10-23 Got it to work! Items now toggle upon click of their list item - see 10-23 on website or in 10-23.js for code behind it. Need to fix :hover to display preview of item
* 10-22 Still trying to figure out adding "display: block" to an item and removing that class from the rest at the same time
* 10-20 X's vs Os 
* 10-19 Enter Words and Sort
* 10-18 Enter numbers and sort
* 10-17 Cat and Dog Years Conversion 
### ++
* still working on layout
* first 7kyu codeWars challenge!
Spent many hours trying to figure out displaying each daily entry; I found the problem was shown on the console (that a variabloe was already declared because I forgot to unlink my test JS file) 
* always check the console for any problems
