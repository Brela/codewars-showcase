# brela's codeWars
This site is collection my coding challenges<br>
The purpose of this is to track my journey of learning JavaScript.<br>
Some of my coding challenges appear on this site, while the less interesting ones are in the repository <a href="https://github.com/Brela/coding-challenges" target="_blank">"coding-challenges"</a> without a User Interface
## live site: <a href="https://brela-codewars.netlify.app/" target="_blank">brela-codewars.netlify.app</a>
### tech used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
### notes
* JS/codingChallenges-with-userInput.js - JavaScript code to make the coding challenges work with user input (these are designated with stars ⭐ on the GUI)
* JS/siteOperations.js - JavaScript/ jQuery code to make the whole page and layout work - a user can click a list item on left and it's content displays in main section

### highlights
✔️used jQuery to make 'hover item shows preview' and to work only on device width > 1000px<br>
✔️used JS to create click events for each list item (see JS/siteOperation.js)<br>
✔️practiced keeping a large html file clean and organized<br>
