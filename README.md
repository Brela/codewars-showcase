# codeWars
Here are my daily codeWars challenges / JS portfolio<br>
The purpose of this is to track my journey of learning JavaScript
## Live Site: <a href="https://brela-codewars.netlify.app/" target="_blank">brela-codewars.netlify.app</a>

### Notes
* main.js - JS to make list items with stars ⭐ work (usually with user input) 
* script.js - JS/ jQuery code to make functions for the whole page and layout work
* DailyJScode Folder - contains many .js files; each one is just a reference to that date's codewWars challenge (that's where I worked it out and screenshot it)

## highlights
✔️used first jQuery to make 'hover item shows preview' work only on device width > 1000px
✔️used JS to create click events for each list item
## toDo
📌fix hover on certain sections
📌fix mobile
📌learn how to use jQuery to make JS hover events work for only mobile

## week 10-23-2022
<strong>10-25</strong>  used <strong>jQuery for the first time!!!!</strong>
<strong>10-24</strong> added some css mobile queries | fixed part of hover problem by moving from css :hover to JS mouseenter/ mouselave

## week 10-17-2022
<strong>10-23</strong> Got it to work! Items now toggle upon click of their list item - see 10-23 on website or in 10-23.js for code behind it. Need to fix :hover to display preview of item

<strong>10-22</strong> Still trying to figure out adding "display: block" to an item and removing that class from the rest at the same time

<strong>10-20</strong> X's vs Os | 10-19 Enter Words and Sort | 10-18 Enter numbers and sort | <strong>10-17</strong> Cat and Dog Years Conversion 

* working on layout
* first 7kyu codeWars challenge!
Spent many hours trying to figure out displaying each daily entry; I found the problem was shown on the console (that a variabloe was already declared because I forgot to unlink my test JS file) 
* always check the console for any problems
